You can use the [Apidog CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apidog-cli) to run test scenarios in Apidog and generate an HTML report. This reporter offers a better custom template to make test reports more user-friendly.

The reporter presents an overview dashboard with important information from the test report and interactively displays basic details of requests, enabling users to find needed information more efficiently.

This reporter is custom developed based on [newman-reporter-htmlextra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman-reporter-htmlextra), â€” **special thanks to the author.**
